                            Almost anyone in this world of course consumes meat, but do you know what is the most popular type of meat?
                            Here there will be 4 types of meat to be compared with each other that is <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">poultry</span>, 
                            <span style="color: #0324fc;font-weight: bold;">beef</span>, <span style="color: #fc038c;font-weight: bold;">pig</span> and lastly <span style="color: #964B00;font-weight: bold;">sheep</span>
                            <br><br> In this visualisations we will dive deeper into the meat consumption worldwide throughout the years.
                            <br><br> First of all, from this lolipop chart we can see that in the year 2022 <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">poultry</span> is leading among all other types of meat
                            with a total value of 133,696 thousand tonnes consumed. <span style="color: #964B00;font-weight: bold;">Sheep</span> is the lowest with only 15,965 thousand tonnes consumed.
                            <br><br> The year slider is available to check at which year how each type of meat was consumed, but its hard to compare at a certain point of the year 
                            so let's take a better look in our donut chart. 
                        </div>

                            With the intervals of 10 years since 1990 we have seen a significance changes in the meat type consumption throughout 
                            the years. 
                            <br><br> In the 1990s we can see that <span style="color: #fc038c;font-weight: bold;">pig</span> was the most consumed type of meat with a total 
                            of 41.25%.  <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">poultry</span> was the 3rd most consumed with 22.47%.
                            <br><br> We can see the changes clearly that more people are consuming <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">poultry</span> it even surpasses <span style="color: #0324fc;font-weight: bold;">beef</span> in the year 2000 
                            being the 2nd most consumed with 29.82%. <span style="color: #fc038c;font-weight: bold;">pig</span> still stays on the top with 39.28%
                            <br><br> 2010 datas ranking seems to be similar with 2000, the more interesting information is in 2020.
                            Surprisingly <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">poultry</span> becomes the most consumed type of meat among all of the others with
                            total percentage of 40.51%.

                            The growing trend between these 4 types of meat is depicted from this line chart.
                            Highlight of the visualisation is how massive people have grown to eat <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">poultry</span>.
                            <br><br> <span style="color: #fcd303;font-weight: bold;">Poultry</span> consumption surpasses <span style="color: #0324fc;font-weight: bold;">beef</span> in 1996, and also later in 2016 surpasses <span style="color: #fc038c;font-weight: bold;">pig</span>
                            being the highest of all. 
                            <br><br> It is not quite a surprise that <span style="color: #964B00;font-weight: bold;">sheep</span> meat consumption is lowest of all

                            Previous visualisations are all for worldwide, but how about OECD Countries? 
                            <br><br> This map visualises the consumptions of the OECD countries throughout the world,
                            the color represents the meat type and the sizes tells us which country consumes more as the 
                            symbol grows bigger.
                            <br><br> Starting from <b>America</b>, the <b>northern</b> part country that consumes the most in all type of meat is the <b>United States</b>.
                            While in the <b> southern</b> part <b>Brazil</b> is the highest consumer.
                            <br><br> Whereas in <b>Europe</b>, <b>Russia</b> is the top consumer for all type of meat.

                            more <span style="color: #964B00;font-weight: bold;">sheep</span> meat than South africa countries which is an interesting point to note.
                            <br><br> Year slider interactivity is given so that users can see the sizes in certain years, drop-down box is also provided
                            to pick the type of meats.

                            reigns on top, its also amusing to note that <span style="color: #A0CBE8;font-weight: bold;">Brazil</span> holds the 2nd spot and not <span style="color: #F28E2B;font-weight: bold;">China</span> until 2018. But still got overtaken after that
